In this project, I implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. I first started on an example 2D dataset (data.mat) to helped me gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After that, I used the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.
